Student Name: [Your Name]
Student Number: [Your Student Number]

## Slide 1: Problem Introduction
**Title: Understanding the Challenge**

- Social media platforms need to handle millions of users and photos
- Traditional websites cannot easily scale as user numbers grow
- Storing and serving images quickly becomes challenging
- Need to manage different user roles (creators vs consumers)
- Must ensure fast loading times even when many people use the site

## Slide 2: Scalability Issues
**Title: Key Scalability Challenges**

- Photo storage grows very quickly as users upload content
- Database performance slows down with too many users and comments
- Authentication system must handle many login requests
- Web servers can get overloaded during peak usage times
- Need to handle network traffic efficiently across different regions

## Slide 3: Technical Solution Overview
**Title: Architecture Design**

- Cloud-native application built on Azure platform
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling of components
- RESTful API design for communication between frontend and backend
- Containerized application deployment for flexibility
- Stateless design principles for horizontal scaling

## Slide 4: Frontend Implementation
**Title: User Interface Design**

- Modern responsive design using Bootstrap framework
- Instagram-inspired user interface with intuitive controls
- Separate views for creator and consumer user roles
- Client-side caching to improve performance
- Static content hosted on Azure Blob Storage with CDN

## Slide 5: Backend Implementation
**Title: Server-Side Components**

- Flask Python framework for API endpoints
- Azure App Service for hosting the application
- Azure MySQL database for user data and metadata
- Azure Blob Storage for photo content
- Azure CDN for fast content delivery worldwide

## Slide 6: Authentication & Security
**Title: User Management System**

- Role-based access control (creators vs consumers)
- JWT token-based authentication for API security
- HTTPS encryption for all traffic
- Input validation to prevent common security issues
- Secure media upload handling with file type validation

## Slide 7: Advanced Feature: Media Processing
**Title: Intelligent Media Handling**

- Automatic image resizing for different device sizes
- Thumbnail generation for faster gallery loading
- Metadata extraction from uploaded images
- Content moderation using Azure Cognitive Services
- Location tagging with map integration

## Slide 8: Advanced Feature: Caching & Performance
**Title: Speed and Responsiveness**

- Multi-level caching strategy for photos and API responses
- Azure Redis Cache for frequently accessed data
- Content Delivery Network for global photo distribution
- Lazy loading of images for faster page loading
- Database query optimization and indexing

## Slide 9: Limitations of Current Implementation
**Title: Current Constraints**

- Limited video support capabilities
- No automated content moderation system yet
- Search functionality is basic without advanced filtering
- Mobile app version not yet developed
- Analytics and reporting features are minimal

## Slide 10: Future Scalability Enhancements
**Title: Scaling for Growth**

- Implement Azure Kubernetes Service for container orchestration
- Add Azure Functions for serverless background processing
- Implement database sharding for increased data volume
- Geo-replication of databases for global performance
- Advanced analytics with Azure Data Lake and Power BI

## Slide 11: Video Demonstration
**Title: Live System Demonstration**

- Working application demonstration
- User registration and login process
- Creator uploading photos with metadata
- Consumer browsing and interacting with content
- Backend monitoring and scaling features

## Slide 12: Conclusion
**Title: Summary and Key Takeaways**

- Successfully built a scalable photo-sharing application
- Implemented role-based user system with different views
- Used cloud-native components for reliability and performance
- Applied modern development practices and patterns
- Platform can grow with increasing user numbers and content
